abstract = {Crib notes, paper mills, cell phones, copying and pasting from the Internet, hand signals during exams, copying homework-the ways in which students engage in academically dishonest behaviors are numerous, and research suggests that most students cheat at some point in their college careers. In addition, some studies indicate that business students are more likely to cheat than students in other disciplines. Much research has been conducted to determine the prevalence of academic dishonesty and to discover characteristics of those who engage in academic dishonesty. Less research attempts to develop a general model for understanding underlying motives or predispositions for engaging in this behavior. Such a model may assist faculty with efforts to reduce or eliminate academic dishonesty. Our study develops and tests a model of student cheating that is derived from a model of dishonest behavior in business: the fraud triangle. Participants in this study were 476 business students. The study showed that each of the elements of the fraud triangle-incentive, rationalization and opportunity-is a significant determinant of student cheating. We also analyzed the results for impacts related to student GPA, student gender, hours spent working per week, student age, and frequency of partying behavior. Results show that age and frequency of partying were also significant determinants of student cheating. Implications for faculty are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {To demonstrate and maintain academic integrity, some institutions require proctor supervision of online exams. However, proctoring can be very expensive. Costs to students can include fees at testing centers, costs to purchase the Remote Proctor, time to find an approved proctor, and effort required to coordinate a time for the exam. Costs to the institution include salaries of staff to administer a proctoring process, approval of proctors, maintaining testing centers, and potential loss of enrollments and revenue since not all institutions require proctors for online exams. This paper examines the control issues related to online exams and asserts that the total cost of proctors for online exams (time and money of both students and the institution) exceed potential benefits. The authors propose a less costly, non-proctor alternative to promote academic honesty, using eight control procedures that enable faculty to increase the difficulty and thus reduce the likelihood of cheating by students.},

abstract = {"Theories are practical because they allow knowledge to be accumulated in a systematic manner and this accumulated knowledge enlightens professional practice" (Gregor, 2007). Abstract The common understanding of Design Science Research in Information Systems (DSRIS) continues to evolve. Only in the broadest terms has there been consensus: that DSRIS involves, in some way, learning through the act of building. However, what is to be built-the definition of the DSRIS artifact-and how it is to be built-the methodology of DSRIS-has drawn increasing discussion in recent years. The relationship of DSRIS to theory continues to make up a significant part of the discussion: how theory should inform DSRIS and whether or not DSRIS can or should be instrumental in developing and refining theory. In this paper we present the exegesis of a DSRIS research project in which creating a (prescriptive) design theory through the process of developing and testing an IS artifact is inextricably bound to the testing and refinement of its kernel theory. 2},

abstract = {Objective: This study tested the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a predictor of growth in risky college drinking over a 3-month period. As predicted by the TPB model, it was hypothesized that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control would predict intention to engage in risky drinking, which would in turn predict growth in future risky drinking. Method: Participants were 837 college drinkers (64.2% female) who were randomly selected from two U.S. West Coast universities to participate in a larger study on college drinking norms. This study used latent growth analyses to test the ability of the TPB to predict baseline levels of as well as linear and quadratic growth in risky college drinking (i.e., heavy episodic drinking and peak drinking quantity). Results: Chi-square tests and fit indices indicated close fit for the final structural models. Self-efficacy, attitudes, and subjective norms significantly predicted baseline intention, which in turn predicted future heavy episodic drinking. Self-efficacy and attitudes were also related to intention in the model of peak drinking; however, subjective norms were not a significant predictor of intention in the peak drinking model. Mediation analyses showed that intention to engage in risky drinking mediated the effects of self-efficacy and attitudes on growth in risky drinking. Conclusions: Findings supported the TPB in predicting risky college drinking. Although the current findings should be replicated before definitive conclusions are drawn, results suggest that feedback on self-efficacy, attitudes, and intentions to engage in risky drinking may be a helpful addition to personalized feedback interventions for this population.},

abstract = {Platforms are an emblem and embodiment of the digital era just as factories were of the industrial revolution. Digital platforms, through their power in their respective ecosystems, are intermediating and contributing to the reorganization of ever-greater segments of the economy and society. As this occurs, existing firms, jobs, and labor relationships are being displaced or transformed, even while new tasks and enterprises are emerging, and existing firms are adjusting.This paper explores the ways in which platform firms are insinuating themselves into ever more parts of the economy. These platforms are integrating existing firms and service providers ever more tightly into their orbit. Existing firms, paradoxically, benefiting from and challenged by platform firms, are facing difficult adjustments to their role and power in their respective value chains.The specific impact of platforms in particular cases is evident. Assessing the impact of the rise of the platform economy on the broader economy is more difficult, despite the acknowledged increase in amount of commerce conducted through or affected by platforms. To measure the sheer breadth of the economic activity affected by platforms, it is necessary to consider the diversity of platforms throughout the economy, the size, as well as the power of the ecosystems controlled by dominant platforms. The expansion of the scale and scope of platforms has implications for inter-firm competition and for which firms capture the value generated by economic activity. To that end, we illustrate the extent to which platforms are intermediating a large share of economic relationships across the economy. We present a framework for understanding of the impact of digital platforms on society and provide evidence of the power that platforms possess. To provide a granular analysis of the vectors of the expansion of platform power, we use a case study of Amazon to demonstrate the ways in which it affects a wide variety of industries.We argue that platforms are private regulatory structures for those connecting or transacting through a platform. Such structures constitute a web of private regulation that organizes and shapes economic activity with little or no public oversight. The enormous reach of these platforms and their “regulator-like” power within their ecosystems compel us to consider whether private platform regulators are replacing many of the state's functions.},

abstract = {The use of unproctored internet-based testing (UIT) for employee selection is quite widespread. Although this mode of testing has advantages over onsite testing, researchers and practitioners continue to be concerned about potential malfeasance (e.g., cheating and response distortion) under high-stakes conditions. Therefore, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the magnitude and extent of high- and low-stakes retest effects on the scores of a UIT speeded cognitive ability test and two UIT personality measures. These data permitted inferences about the magnitude and extent of malfeasant responding. The study objectives were accomplished by implementing two within-subjects design studies (Study 1 N=296; Study 2 N=318) in which test takers first completed the tests as job applicants (high-stakes) or incumbents (low-stakes) then as research participants (low-stakes). For the speeded cognitive ability measure, the pattern of test score differences was more consonant with a psychometric practice effect than a malfeasance explanation. This result is likely due to the speeded nature of the test. And for the UIT personality measures, the pattern of higher high-stakes scores compared with lower low-stakes scores is similar to those reported for proctored tests in the extant literature. Thus, our results indicate that the use of a UIT administration does not uniquely threaten personality measures in terms of elevated scores under high-stakes testing that are higher than those observed for proctored tests in the extant literature. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The behavioralscience paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

abstract = {Purpose: A growing body of research from various domains has investigated Airbnb, a two-sided market platform for peer-based accommodation sharing. The authors suggest that it is due time to take a step back and assess the current state of affairs. This paper aims to conflate and synthesize research on Airbnb. Design/methodology/approach: To facilitate research on Airbnb and its underlying principles in electronic commerce, the authors present a structured literature review on Airbnb. Findings: The findings are based on 118 articles from the fields of tourism, information and management, law and economics between 2013 and 2018. Based on this broad basis, the authors find that: research on Airbnb is highly diverse in terms of domains, methods and scope; motives for using Airbnb are manifold (e.g. financial, social and environmental); trust and reputation are considered crucial by almost all scholars; the platform's variety is reflected in prices; and the majority of work is based on surveys and empirical data while experiments are scarce. Practical implications: Based on the present assessment of studied topics, domains, methods and combinations thereof, the authors suggest that research should move toward building atop of a common ground of data structures and vocabulary, and that attention should focus on the identified gaps and hitherto scarcely used combinations. The set of under-represented areas includes cross-cultural investigations, field experiments and audit studies, the consideration of dynamic processes (e.g. based on panel data), Airbnb's “experiences” and automated pricing algorithms and the rating distribution's skewness. Originality/value: This study provides a comprehensive overview of work on the accommodation sharing platform Airbnb, to the best of the auhtors' knowledge, representing the first systematic literature review. The authors hope that researchers and practitioners alike will find this review useful as a reference for future research on Airbnb and as a guide for the development of innovative applications based on the platform's peculiarities and paradigms in electronic commerce practice. From a practical perspective, the general tenor suggests that hotel and tourism operators may benefit from: focusing on their core advantages over Airbnb and differentiating features and aligning their marketing communication with their users' aspirations.},

The students used approximately the same time to study for an online examination as for faculty examination, but over half of them reported using more time for responding and learning more from an online examination compared to a faculty examination. The study supports the earlier findings that assessment methods are essential for students' learning experiences and that self-efficacy beliefs are essential in positive learning experiences. It also indicates that self-efficacy is affected differently for different students by the online context and that the individual differences in experiencing the learning environment should be taken into account in assessment procedures.},

Undoubtedly, the advent of the Internet and advances in user-friendly technological devices have spurred both concern on the part of faculty and research interest in the academic community regarding inappropriate and unethical behavior on the part of students. This study is designed to (a) gauge the attitudes of business students toward various issues and behaviors when taking an examination 'online' and (b) obtain an estimate of the extent of cheating in traditional versus online coursework from the perspective of college students. The results, based on a sample of 121 undergraduate business students from a university in the South, indicate that respondents felt quite liberal in their views of potentially cheating behaviors when there was no test-taking policy set by the course instructor. In addition, 73.6% of the students in the sample held the perception that it is easier to cheat in an online versus traditional course. We believe that, based on prior research, the current results would be applicable to general student populations in other academic disciplines. The findings are discussed in light of prior research on academic integrity issues and recommendations for future research are noted.},

abstract = {Digital exams are not the most common practice in Norwegian higher education, but it is being tested and used at several institutions. Exams are normally con- ducted on pen and paper with limited access to resources, and it has been a chal- lenge to make an affordable, digital adaption for this type of exams. One approach to create this digital exam environment, is with the use of lock- down browsers on student owned computers. At NTNU they have chosen to use a lock-down browser called Safe Exam Browser, which is continuously being im- proved and is widely used for digital exams. This thesis will look into whether Safe Exam Browser sufficiently protects against cheating during a digital Bring-Your-Own-Device exam. It will be a technical evaluation of Safe Exam Browser as a software, that ensures a secured exam envi- ronment and helps mitigate cheating behaviors. The vulnerabilities of Safe Exam Browser is discovered, evaluated and tested with penetration testing. Safe Exam Browser does have vulnerabilities, and some of them are presented in this thesis. It is open source and for exams conducted at NTNU, it is installed on the examinees' personal computers, and it will always be possible that someone choose to use a corrupted version to be able to cheat. There are different mecha- nisms in this software, to detect and deny access to exams, if the lock-down browser has been modified. These mechanisms make it harder, but not impossible, to make and use a corrupted version.},

abstract = {Academic cheating has become a widespread problem among high school and college students. In this study, 490 students (ages 14 to 23) evaluated the acceptability of an act of academic dishonesty under 19 different circumstances where a person's motive for transgressing differed. Students' evaluations were related to self-reports of cheating behavior, sex, school grade, and psychological variables. Results indicated that high school and college students took motives into account when evaluating the acceptability of academic cheating. Cheating behavior was more common among those who evaluated cheating leniently, among male students, and among high schoolers. Also, acceptance of cheating and cheating behavior were negatively related to self-restraint, but positively related to tolerance of deviance. The results are discussed with reference to biological, cultural, and developmental factors. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {The requirement to provide timely formative tasks that are designed to facilitate student learning and autonomy has provoked a wider examination of the role of assessment in higher education and encouraged further investigation of the alignment of learning, teaching and assessment in curriculum design frameworks. Many current authors have proposed that the primary purpose of assessment is to enhance current and future learning and that current practice tends to overemphasise the importance of assessment for progression and certification purposes. This paper proposes that a clearer distinction be made between assessment tasks designed to facilitate and test current learning through the use of formative and summative assessments, and those tasks primarily designed to enhance future learning, which could be better termed integrative assessments. This distinction would allow students and teachers to have greater clarity around the proposed outcomes and reward mechanisms associated with assessment tasks and feedback. This paper proposes that teachers should strive to incorporate four different types of assessment tasks throughout a programme of study, namely diagnostic, formative, integrative and summative tasks, and that the outcomes and reward mechanisms for different assessment types be explained more clearly to students. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

While general deterrence theory has been extensively used in Behavioural Information Security research with the aim to explain the effect of deterrent factors on employees' security actions, these studies provide inconsistent and even contradictory findings. Therefore, a further examination of deterrent factors in the security context is required. The aim of this study is to contribute to the emerging field of Behavioural Information Security research by investigating how a combination of security countermeasures and cultural factors impact upon employee security behaviour in organisations. A particular focus of this project is to explore the effect of national culture and organisational culture on employee actions as regards information security. Preliminary findings suggest that organisational culture, national culture, and security countermeasures do have an impact upon employee security behaviour.},

abstract = {Many scientific and engineering challenges—ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations—require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

abstract = {Through multi-agent competition, the simple objective of hide-and-seek, and standard reinforcement learning algorithms at scale, we find that agents create a self-supervised autocurriculum inducing multiple distinct rounds of emergent strategy, many of which require sophisticated tool use and coordination. We find clear evidence of six emergent phases in agent strategy in our environment, each of which creates a new pressure for the opposing team to adapt; for instance, agents learn to build multi-object shelters using moveable boxes which in turn leads to agents discovering that they can overcome obstacles using ramps. We further provide evidence that multi-agent competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. Finally, we propose transfer and fine-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-specific intelligence tests.},

The argument proceeds from the idea that climate change-induced migration is an example of the absolute. It then traces how the absolute finds expression in two versions of the discourse on climate change and migration: the sovereigntist and liberal variations. The principle argument is that when we reduce the debate on climate change and migration to a set of competing secular claims we risk overlooking the theological dimensions of the debate. Consequently, we risk posing the wrong the questions about what is at stake in the phenomenon. The paper argues in favour of using the phenomenon of climate change-induced migration as an occasion to ask: what does it mean to be human in the context of climate change? Keywords:},

abstract = {When talking about authentication in general and biometrics in particular, we envisage a situation where a user provides an identity and gives proof of this identity, in order to get access to certain services. This kind of authentication (called static authentication) is done when first accessing a service and will be valid throughout a full session, until the user logs off from that session. Most authentication methods are very well suited for this kind of (static) authentication, e.g. the well known username/password combination for access to computers or websites. In this article we will discuss a different kind of authentication, which will be applied after the start of a session, and will monitor if the current user is the same as the user who performed the initial static authentication. This new type of authentication is called dynamic authentication or continuous authentication. We will in particular look at sessions at a computer where we monitor the typing behavior of the user to detect anomalies. Normal techniques used in biometrics cannot be applied anymore. We will explain the differences between static and continuous keystroke dynamics and we will show, using the performance of an experiment, that continuous authentication using keystroke dynamics can be a valuable addition to computer security. In order to use continuous authentication we designed the concept of a penalty-and-reward function to measure the confidence that the user has not changed during a session.},

The study then evaluates the magnitude and extent to which students are willing to confront the realities of academic fraud and move towards a culture of academic integrity. Most of the studies pertaining to combating academic fraud have primarily been the opinions of the researchers, namely, the faculty. Although students may not be expected to police the fight against academic fraud, their opinions as to what would work and what would not, have not been sufficiently examined, and this study contributes to filling that void. We explore the agreement among students and groups of students concerning specific deterrent strategies. We find two types of strategies, student action and faculty/administration action. Results from 740 students surveyed found that the most widely supported strategies are stronger penalties, parental notification, an anonymous tip line, and administering a uniform policy. The least supported strategies were academic honor code, no strategy at all, requiring an ethics course, and leaving individual instructors to determine penalties. Further, full time, domestic, undergraduate, and male students favor student action strategies, which are more reactionary and less punitive. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Despite the documented increase in individual student cheating and the increasing use of team assignments in business schools, only a handful of recent empirical studies in the management literature have addressed the decision to cheat collaboratively. To date, no peer-reviewed, theoretically rigorous model of such behavior exists. Our work here presents a game theoretical model of team cheating based on rational choice, in which students choose a path with benefits or payouts typical of most university settings, given their assessment of the probability that other team members will cheat. Additionally, we show how incentives to cheat can be altered to make cheating a more or less rationally attractive choice depending on factors such as the psychological safety felt by team members, individual expectations that other team members will cheat, possible fear of group exclusion, the relationship between leader dominance and group member agreeableness, and students' expectations that harsh penalties will be applied. We then propose a general, utility-based model for considering "subjectively" rational choices in which students may choose not to collude in cheating despite economic payouts which would encourage such behavior. We conclude with implications for academia, applications to the workplace, and directions for future research. {\textcopyright} Academy of Management Learning & Education.},

abstract = {Time pressures often necessitate the use of more efficient exam tools, such as electronic exams (e-exams), instead of traditional paper exams. However, teachers may face challenges when introducing e-exams in a higher education context. This paper describes what kinds of challenges teachers may face when introducing e-exams, based on experiences in Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) where e-exams have been used since 2012. For this research, the authors used their personal experiences as administrators and teachers of current e-systems used for e-exams in universities in Turku, Finland. Quantitative data were collected by survey from teachers in TUAS (the case study). The learning management systems, Moodle, Optima and ViLLE, and dedicated e-examination systems, Soft Tutor and Tenttis, were also compared to clarify what kind of features are available in order to ease teachers' work with examinations. The results identified various challenges during e-exam introduction in TUAS. The paper also provides a list of essential services or features for teachers to ease the introduction of e-exams. Among the analysed systems, ViLLE supported most of the required features, and can be used for both learning management and e-examination systems, providing teachers with one single system, which was found to be important to teachers. The key service found by this paper is 'support for teachers', which is in line with previous studies.},

Using a game theoretic approach, we propose a design of an economic incentive mechanism, the trusted third party (TTP), to serve the online auction communities. The proposed model addresses both the economic and technological aspects of online auction transactions by assigning a digital certificate to each participant. Thus, each participant's identity as well as his or her reputation can be established by other market participants. The analytical results demonstrate that when online transactions take place with the assistance of digital certificates issued by a TTP, the most utilitarian course of action for a market participant is to behave honestly. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {According to Martell and Calderon (2005), assessment is an ongoing process that involves planning, discussion, consensus building, reflection, measuring, analyzing, and improving based on the data and artifacts gathered about a learning objective. Assessment encompasses a range of activities including testing, performances, project ratings, and observations (Orlich, Harder, Callahan & Gibson, 2004). Impacting education from early childhood through graduate studies, the assessment movement is based on standards and outcomes, measuring results, and holding educational institutions accountable for student learning. Oversight bodies and accrediting agencies are beginning to require the establishment of learner-centered outcomes that reflect the well-rounded knowledge, competencies,and abilities preferred in today's students; the alignment of curriculum to reflect the desired progression and cognitive development of learners; the collection of data that demonstrates the satisfaction of learning objectives; and the use of assessment information to inform decision making (Buzzetto-More, 2006). The use of information technologies and e-learning strategies can provide an efficient and effective means of assessing teaching and learning effectiveness by supporting traditional, authentic, and alternative assessment protocols (Bennett, 2002). According to Vendlinski and Stevens (2002) technology offers new measures for assessing learning that will yield rich sources of data and expand the ways in which educators understand both learning mastery, and teaching effectiveness. The use of information technologies and e-learning to augment the assessment process may include: pre and post testing, diagnostic analysis, student tracking, rubric use, the support and delivery of authentic assessment through project based learning, artifact collection, and data aggregation and analysis. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the origins, evolution, and key concepts of assessment as well as illustrate some of the ways in which technology and e-Learning serve as the most promising mechanisms for satisfying assessment goals and objectives. This work is based on an exhaustive review of literature, the analysis of a number of critically acclaimed assessment programs, as well as the authors' own work in the development and use of e-Learning in the design, and implementation of an assessment program at a mid-sized institution of higher education located in the rural Eastern Shore of Maryland in the United States. The program being profiled includes computerized longitudinal testing, online diagnostic testing, competitive networked simulations, rubrics, student discussion transcripts, taped presentations,},

abstract = {Feedback on assessment tasks has an important part to play in underpinning student learning. Online assessment enables instantaneous feedback to be given so that the student can act on it immediately. However, concern has been expressed that e-assessment tasks (especially multiple-choice questions) can encourage surface-learning. Several projects at the UK Open University are investigating the use of rich interactive e-assessment. One of these projects is using a linguistically based authoring tool to enable sophisticated answer matching for free-text responses of up to a sentence in length. Immediate tailored feedback is provided on incorrect and incomplete responses, and students are able to use this feedback in reattempting the question. Students have been observed attempting the questions and were seen to answer them in different ways, with most students using short phrases but some using full and carefully constructed sentences and some using note form. There was evidence that some students assumed the system to be looking only for keywords. A human-computer marking comparison has demonstrated the computer-based answer matching to be of similar or greater accuracy than that of six course tutors.},

The TPM, along with other hardware, can implement a cloaked computation, whose memory state cannot be observed by any other software, including the operating system and hypervisor. We show that malware can use cloaked computations to hide essential secrets (like the target of an attack) from a malware analyst. We describe and implement a protocol that establishes an encryption key under control of the TPM that can only be used by a specific infection program. An infected host then proves the legitimacy of this key to a remote malware distribution platform, and receives and executes an encrypted payload in a way that prevents software visibility of the decrypted payload. We detail how malware can benefit from cloaked computations and discuss defenses against our protocol. Hardening legitimate uses of the TPM against attack improves the resilience of our malware, creating a Catch-22 for secure computing technology.},
