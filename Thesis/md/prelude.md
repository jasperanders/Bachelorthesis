## The E-Examination process

E-examinations have become more mainstream over the last few years. There is some new law that makes tests more common, this needs a citation. Till this now e-assessments do not fully leverage the potential of new technologie. Most often e-exams are quite similar to paperbased exams in their setup. Universities like Berlin or Berkly (this one talk of the conference) place their students in a lecture hall where now instead of paper they find a computer. Of course this allowes the use of multimedia content in tests, such as pictures and videos.

One must distinguish between exams that are taken on site and exams that are taken in the comfort of the own home. They differ in some very important aspects: As we will see the device a student is using cannot fully be secured thus the question design must be completely different.

First lets think about why we want students to take the exam in a lecture hall. This may seem trivial but it reveals the major requirements any examination system should have. So what is the status quo

### pre testday

1. The exam is conceptualized
2. The exam is layout
3. The exam is tested and improved upon, sharing is required

### on testday

1. Students take the exam on a specific day at a specific time.
2. Students only have access to essential tools (e.g. pencil, possibly a calculator)
3. Students identity is checked by looking at student identy cards
4. If students speak during the exam they are expelled from the exam
5. Tests are collected and brought to a cental place

### after testday

1. Tests are checked for correctness [!]
2. Points are counted
3. Grades are released
4. Exam results are reviewed by students at a specific time and space

## Problems of e-exams

Although e-exams yield great potential of major improvements in the test taking process they behave consideratebly different than paperbase exams an thus need rethinking. 
In the following we will discuss these differences while accounting for problems. 
In order to better understand these problems I propose a seperation into two different categories:
Problems that arise from the changed infrastructure and problems that are tied to change behaviours of one of the testing parties.
First lets consider the **infrastuctural** problems:

The main point may be that a stabel internet connection in of utmost importance.

Second  
  
  - **Infrastructural**
  - **Integrity Problems**
- Three categories of problems (substantively, infrastructural, integrity) **S**
