## Problems to solve:

E-Education has become more essential than ever. Now also a feasable **Online Based Testing Solution** is needed. Thinking about such a solution makes it a necessity to look at the major requirements.

- **The students' side of testing**

    is focused on the online tests **integrity:**

- **The infrastructure side of testing**

    Considering **environmental requirements**

    - Tests must **not** **rely** on a stable **internet connection**
    - Tests must be **reviewable** and **regradable**
