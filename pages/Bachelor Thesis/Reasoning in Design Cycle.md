# Reasoning in Design Cycle

## Problems to solve:

In the current crisis E-Education has become more essential than ever. Despite, there is no widely adopted **Online Based Testing Solution**. This may be due to the fact, that most computer based testing solutions are used in a one site environment. Resulting in systems that lack certain design considerations. These requirements can be partially drawn from the *PrÃ¼fungsordung* of the KIT and from economic implications of the examination process.

> The gist is: The examination process has to be both economically and provide high integrity.

- **The students' side of testing**

    Focus on the online tests **integrity:**

    - Students don't use additional, **disallowed** **aid**
    - Students **cannot cooperate**
    - The **students' identity** is confirmed
    - Students **don't have access to test questions** beforehand

- **The educators' side of testing**

    Focus on **major quality of life improvements** due to technical aid:

    - Test questions must be **reusable**
    - The software must aid the educator in **checking** the test answers
    - The educator must have a means of **conveying** his **decisions** in the process of checking tests
    - The educator must have a **dashboard** for reviewing overall test results

- **The infrastructure side of testing**

    Focus on **environmental requirements:**

    - Tests must **not** **rely** on a stable **internet connection**
    - Tests must be **reviewable** and **re-gradable**
