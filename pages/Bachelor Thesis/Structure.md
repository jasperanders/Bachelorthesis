# Structure

1. Introduction
    - What is it, I am building?
    - Why am I building it?
2. General problems of the e-examination process
    - How is an Exam structured? (citation needed)
    - Three categories of problems (substantively, infrastructural, integrity) **S**
        - **Substantively**
        - **Infrastructural**
        - **Integrity Problems**
3. Design Oriented Research
4. Artifact Description
5. Evaluation
6. The Future 

In this work a MVP is proposed that aims to improve the examination process. This prototype showcases specific design consideration that either are completely missing or are only partly present in current systems. In that way these new design ideas can be evaluated without completely rebuilding a polished system.
